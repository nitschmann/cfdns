## cfdns

CLI tool to manage Cloudflare DNS records

### Synopsis


cfdns is a tool that allows the management of Cloudflare DNS records via the API easily within a CLI. It also has the option to set dynamically the public IPv4 of the machine (or the network itself), through detection, for specific DNS records. A system wide config file allows working with different profiles (API key and email) at the same time. This tool does NOT cover anything else of the Cloudflare API.
